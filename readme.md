# Spinning Donut
The spinning donut is one of most famous classic challenges for developers. It involves a big research and exploration of math and computer science problems.

This project is my own implementation of this challenge with also a bit of extra features. Here are the features:

#### Base Features
    - 3D Meshes library (Mesh -> Faces -> Vertices) :white_check_mark:
    - Rasterization to terminal screen :white_check_mark:
    - 3D transformations (Rotation, Translation) :white_check_mark:
    - Camera :white_check_mark:
    - 3D Mesh factory (Donut, Cube, Pyramid) :white_check_mark:
    - FPS counter :white_check_mark:

#### Face normals
    - Face normals calculation (to be improved) :black_square_button:
    - Light value based on face normals and light source :white_check_mark:
    - Backface culling (to be improved) :black_square_button:

#### User controls
    - Camera movement (to be implemented) :black_square_button:
    - Mesh rotation :white_check_mark:

#### Performance
    - Performance logs :white_check_mark:

## Challenges
There are many crucial crucial knowlage needed to implement your own Spinning Donut script. But let's start with the definition of our 3D library structure.
