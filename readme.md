# Spinning Donut
The spinning donut is one of most famous classic challenges for developers. It involves a big research and exploration of math and computer science problems.

This project is my own implementation of this challenge with also a bit of extra features. Here are the features:

#### Base Features
    ✅ 3D Meshes library (Mesh -> Faces -> Vertices) 
    ✅ Rasterization to terminal screen
    ✅ 3D transformations (Rotation, Translation)
    ✅ Camera
    ✅ 3D Mesh factory (Donut, Cube, Pyramid)
    ✅ FPS counter

#### Face normals
    ⬜ Face normals calculation (to be improved) 
    ✅ Light value based on face normals and light source
    ⬜ Backface culling (to be improved) 

#### User controls
    ⬜ Camera movement (to be implemented) 
    ✅ Mesh rotation

#### Performance
    ✅ Performance logs

## Challenges
There are many crucial crucial knowlage needed to implement your own Spinning Donut script. But let's start with the definition of our 3D library structure.
